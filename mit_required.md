# Required Elements

Although all of this should go without saying, the Institute requires us to say the following...

## Disabilities

If you have a documented disability or any other problem you think may affect your ability to perform in class, please see one of the instructors early in the semester so that arrangements may be made to accommodate you. If you have not yet been approved for accommodations, please contact [Student Disability Services](https://studentlife.mit.edu/das) at [sds-all@mit.edu](mailto:sds-all@mit.edu).

## Student Support and Wellbeing

As a graduate student, a variety of issues may impact your academic career including faculty/student relationships, funding, and interpersonal concerns. In the Office of Graduate Education (OGE), GradSupport provides consultation, coaching, and advocacy to graduate students on matters related to academic and life challenges. If you are dealing with an issue that is impacting your ability to attend class, complete work, or take an exam, you may contact GradSupport by email at gradsupport@mit.edu or via phone at (617) 253-4860.

## Academic Misconduct

Plagiarism and cheating are both academic crimes. Never (1) turn in an assignment that you did not write yourself, (2) turn in an assignment for this class that you previously turned in for another class, or (3) cheat on an exam. If you do so, it may result in a failing grade for the class, and possibly even suspension from MIT. Please see Professor Susskind or Kelly if you have any questions about what constitutes plagiarism. Anyone caught cheating on an exam will be reported in line with recognized university procedures.
